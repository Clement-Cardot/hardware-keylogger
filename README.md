# Hardware Keylogger

This is a school project for the course "DEEP" at ESEO. The goal is to create a hardware keylogger that can hijack a PS/2 keyboard and store the keystrokes in a buffer & send them to a bluetooth device.

## Why a PS/2 keyboard ?

The PS/2 keyboard is a very simple device that can be easily hijacked.
The main difference with USB is the communication speed, PS/2 is much slower than USB.

To do the same thing with a USB keyboard we would need to use a microcontroller with a faster clock speed.

## Why a Hardware Keylogger ?

Because it's badass !

Joke aside, a hardware keylogger is a very simple device that can be easily hidden in a computer. It's also very hard to detect. Soft hacking is more and more complex and requires a lot of knowledge. Hardware hacking is much simpler and can be done by anyone.

The disadvantage of a hardware keylogger is that you have to place the device by yourself. Therefore it is much more risky !
